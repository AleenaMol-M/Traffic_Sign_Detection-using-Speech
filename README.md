# 🚦 Traffic Sign Detection using Speech

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a Real-Time Traffic Sign Detection System that detects traffic signs using a CNN (ResNet-based model) and provides voice output for the detected sign.

It combines:
- Computer Vision
- Deep Learning (CNN - ResNet)
- Speech Output System

---

## 🎯 Features
- Detects traffic signs using a trained ResNet model
- Real-time webcam detection
- Voice announcement of detected traffic sign
- Clean modular Python implementation

---

## 🧠 Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- OpenCV
- ResNet (CNN)
- Text-to-Speech
- NumPy

---

## ⚠️ Note

Due to GitHub file size limitations, the trained model file (`.h5`) and dataset are not uploaded.  
You can generate the model by running the training script.

---

## 📌 Future Improvements
- Improve accuracy using data augmentation
- Deploy as a web application
- Optimize for mobile devices
- Add more traffic sign classes
